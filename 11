STEP 1: Enable Pipeline Settings
Go to your Azure DevOps Organization.

Click on "Organization Settings" (bottom-left corner).

Then click on "Pipeline Settings".

You’ll see some options related to pipeline features.

STEP 2: Enable Classic Release Pipelines
Find the setting called “Disable creation of classic pipeline”.

Turn this OFF (i.e., allow classic pipeline creation).

This lets you create Release pipelines (older but useful UI-based deployments).

STEP 3: Check for Release Option
Now go back to the Pipelines section.

You will now see the “Releases” tab visible.

This allows you to set up release pipelines that can deploy your app to services like Azure App Services.

STEP 4: Run Test Plans (Optional)
You can add and run simple test plans within your pipeline.

Test plans help ensure your app works correctly before deploying.
