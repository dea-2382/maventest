 STEP 1: Configure the Ansible Control Node
This is the main system from which you control and configure other servers.

Create a new admin user

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo adduser yourname
Set a password when asked. (You can skip other questions by pressing Enter.)

Give the user sudo (admin) rights

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo usermod -aG sudo yourname
Switch to that user

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo su - yourname
🔐 STEP 2: Set Up SSH Keys
SSH keys help you connect securely without typing a password every time.

Create a key pair

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh-keygen
Just press Enter 3 times to accept the defaults.

🌐 STEP 3: Configure the Remote Host (Other Server)
This is the server you want to control.

Copy your public SSH key to the remote host

bash
Copy
Edit
ssh-copy-id username@remote-ip
Replace username with the user on the remote machine.

Replace remote-ip with the IP address of that machine.

Accept the connection by typing yes and entering the remote password.

📦 STEP 4: Install Ansible
Update your system

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
Install Ansible

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install ansible -y
🔍 STEP 5: Verify Ansible is Installed
Check version

bash
Copy
Edit
ansible --version
You’ll see Ansible’s version and config details.

📝 STEP 6: Set Up the Inventory File
This file tells Ansible which machines it can control.

Create the Ansible config folder

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo mkdir -p /etc/ansible
Create and edit the hosts file

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts
Add this inside the file (to manage your own machine):

bash
Copy
Edit
[local]
localhost ansible_connection=local
Save and exit (Ctrl + O, Enter, then Ctrl + X).

Check the inventory

bash
Copy
Edit
ansible-inventory --list -y
📡 STEP 7: Test the Connection
Ping all hosts to check connection

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo ansible all -m ping
If it works, you’ll see a "pong" reply from each host.
